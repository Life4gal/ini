== Introduction

`ini` is a simple and easy to use `ini file` parser for C++.

- Supports for reading ini files with comments.
- Supports reading comments together.
- Supports writing the read data back to the file without losing the original comments of the file.
- Supports writing data back to the file in the order it was read. (Newly added data is not guaranteed.)

== Requirements

The front-end implementation of the parser is based on the https://github.com/foonathan/lexy[lexy] implementation.
